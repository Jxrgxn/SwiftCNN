# SwiftCNN

Convolutional Neural Networks are commonly used in computer vishion. CNNs take advantage of a signal processing known as convolution. Convolution calculate weighted collection of neighboring elements.Usually this is an array or matrix. Typically, convolutions are used in signal processing to sum a collection of matrices within position of one another. 

The output of this operation is referred to as a _weighted_ sum. 

How do we determine the weight? Via the input, usually another matrix. We refer to 

##Applications 

Convolutions are useful for the following:

- Object Recognition
- Speech Recognition
- Haptics
- Solving Problems with multiple parameters which all need account
